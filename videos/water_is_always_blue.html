<p>A qualitative approach to understanding why water is always blue without the use of quantum mechanics.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Water is blue, even the water in the drinking glass next to you — it’s not just oceans and glaciers. So why does only some water look blue?</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>If you’re like us, you were told as a kid that water is blue because the sky is blue — the water reflects the sky’s colour which makes us perceive it to have the same, or at least a similar colour. This makes sense, but is only a part of why water outside is blue, when really <b>all</b> water is blue and that explanation does not account for this fact.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Background">Background</h2>
<p>Before we go further, here’s a quick refresher on colour: </p>
<br>
<ul><li>“Colour” as we know it corresponds to different wavelengths of light included in the <i>visible spectrum</i> — that is, the range of wavelengths humans can see.
</li></ul>
<br>
<ul><li>Objects absorb different wavelengths of light in different quantities. The part that we see is what remains when amounts of wavelengths are removed.
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>Water, like every object, absorbs some amount of almost all wavelengths of light. However, it absorbs a lot of red, and not a lot of blue! The combination of wavelengths remaining form the colour blue, this is why water is blue.</p>
<br>
<p>This is an important foundation, but it alone doesn’t explain why water is specifically blue of all colours, or why your glass of water doesn’t look like any colour at all.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Science">Science</h2>
<h3 id="Molecules">Molecular Vibration</h3>
<p>Let’s tackle the first point by going to a microscopic point of view. “Why is water <b>specifically</b> blue?”</p>
<br>
<p>As we know, water is the molecule H2O: two hydrogen atoms each covalently single-bonded to one oxygen atom. The covalent bonds act like springs connecting the atoms: they are free to stretch, bend, rock, wag, and twist. This is known as <i>molecular vibration</i>. The <i>frequency</i> of the molecular vibration depends on the mass of the atoms and the strength of the covalent bond connecting them, which is very intuitive.</p>
<br>
<p>A light ray travels through an object until it comes into contact with a molecule. When this happens, the light provides some of its energy to the molecule to begin vibrating. Different wavelengths of light have different energies. Some energies are <b>just right</b> for a certain type of molecular vibration to occur, so they get absorbed most, but almost every wavelength gets absorbed at least a little.</p>
<br>
<p>The mass of the atoms and the strength of the covalent bonds connecting them in water just so happens to cause the molecule to stretch and bend a lot when <b>absorbing</b> wavelengths associated with the colour red. This is why we see water as the colour blue.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="Size">Path Length</h3>
<p>So why doesn’t your glass of water look blue, then? Let’s mix in a macroscopic point of view. The question here is actually, “What determines <b>how</b> blue something is?”</p>
<br>
<p>The thicker an object is, the further the distance light has to travel through it — this distance is called the <i>path length</i> of the light. A larger path length means that there are more opportunities for light to hit the molecules of an object since it is passing through more of them. The more collisions that occur, the more red light is absorbed, yielding a more visible blue.</p>
<br>
<p>This is why large objects, like oceans and glaciers, appear more blue than your glass of water — light has a much larger path length through the ocean than the minuscule size of your cup.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Naturally, the largest bodies of water are outside, under the sky. This is the cause of the confusion. Sure, they do reflect part of the sky’s blue colour, but this has nothing to do with all water being blue. It really comes down to just three key points:</p>
<br>
<ol start="1"><li>Water mostly absorbs the red wavelengths of light because of its molecular properties.
</li><li>We see the absence of the colour red as blue.
</li><li>Larger bodies of water absorb more red wavelengths as light travelling through them has a larger path length — that is, a larger distance for it to travel.
</li></ol>
<br>
<p>This also explains why the bottom of the ocean is so dark. The light had so many molecules to pass through, so many opportunities for collision, that most of it did not make it to the bottom. There is a lot to learn from water being blue.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Postscript">Postscript</h2>
<p>If you were wondering why we kept saying almost all wavelengths of light get absorbed: this is a result of quantum mechanics. Indeed, any explanation we skipped over is due to molecular energies and light itself being quantized. This is beyond the scope of this video, but we hope that even with some precise details omitted, you have a better understanding of why water is blue.</p>
<br>
<p>Heavy water (water created using the hydrogen isotope deuterium) is colourless because it absorbs mostly infrared light as opposed to water’s mostly red absorption. Note the small difference in wavelength between infrared and red light.</p>
<br>
<p>Water molecules can only vibrate by stretching (symmetrically and asymmetrically) and bending because any other type of vibration would simply be a rotation of the molecule.</p>
<br>
<p>Molecules were treated as point particles for the purposes of the animation. Similarly, a single light source was assumed for the colouring of waves.</p>
